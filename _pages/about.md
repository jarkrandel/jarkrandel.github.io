I'm Jared Krandel, a PhD candidate in Math at Stony Brook University who is primarily interested in topics surrounding Geometric Measure Theory. My advisor is [Raanan Schul](http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~schul/). 

I grew up in [Rockford, Illinois](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rockford,+IL/@42.2687732,-89.1007626,13z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8808b9cdfd0300db:0xacad897828f6780!8m2!3d42.2711311!4d-89.0939952) and graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a B.S. in Physics and a B.S. in Math. At UIUC, I dabbled in undergraduate math [research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11139-019-00196-3) at the [IGL](https://math.illinois.edu/research/igl) and got hooked. 

If you're interested in learning about Geometric Measure Theory and have the prerequisite knowledge, I highly recommend Jonas Azzam's [notes and videos](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~jazzam/docs/gmt/) accompanying his graduate level course.
